          Hi, I’m Jay, a passionate coding bootcamp student diving into the
          world of software development. With no prior experience, I’m excited
          to embrace new challenges and continuously learn as I build my skills.
          <br />
          Before starting my coding journey, I was a lead editor for animated
          film and TV. These experiences taught me how to handle deadlines, how
          to deal with a stressful environment and how to lead a team which I
          now apply to my coding projects.
          <br />
          Currently, I’m mastering technologies like React, Node.js, and
          PostgreSQL while working on projects like a CMS Employee Tracker and
          my personal portfolio website.
          <br />
          My goal is to become a full-stack developer and contribute to building
          applications that solve real-world problems. I’m especially fascinated
          by creating intuitive user interfaces, and scalable back-end systems.
          <br />
          When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring fantasy worlds like
          Game of Thrones or rewatching my favorite movie, The Matrix. I also
          enjoy hiking, photography, and gaming.
          <br />
          I’m always open to learning from others and collaborating on exciting
          projects. Feel free to reach out through the links at the bottom or
          the contact page!
